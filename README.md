# Calculator
This is a project that is part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) to create a calculator to be used in a web browser. This was achieved using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
## Reflection
This was the most difficult project that I've encountered so far. The biggest challenge that I ran to was at the end when I decided to refactor everything instead of keeping it all in the pressButton . function. In the future I'll definitely keep in mind to use more functions instead of just make one mega-function. Throughout the process I also learned a lot about keyboard event listeners as well as different ways to manipulate numbers to make them fit within the calculator display
## How to Use
In order to use the project open the latest [Github deployment.](https://github.com/drossano/calculator/deployments/activity_log?environment=github-pages) The calculator can then be operated by either clicking on the buttons or using the keyboard. The corresponding number or operator (+,-,*,/) buttons can be used to perform their functions and then solving an operation can be performed by pressing = or Enter. The backspace key will delete the last entered digit.
